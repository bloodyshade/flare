When it comes to the management aspect of kingdoms, it is no fun to own a kingdom and not own more. As you saw from the 
previous information on this subject, additional kingdoms will cost gold, and since there is no way to make gold 
without fighting or going on adventures or selling items on the market board, you are left with one option 
to get more kingdoms: Find them and take them over.

To do this, you will need a couple of things: Units and settler (preferably more than one).
