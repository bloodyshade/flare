One of the key aspects of Planes of Tlessa is to allow you to settle kingdoms. Kingdoms in Tlessa work differently than other kingdom management games you might have played or are used to. With some similarities but my own spin on it.

Borrowing the idea of settling kingdoms from [racewarkingdoms](), I have made some changes to way they work here.

First, to settle a kingdom you simply move to any location that is not a port or special location. You’ll know if you can settle a kingdom by seeing this button appear in the actions section:

<div class="gallery mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/kingdoms/images/settle-action.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/kingdoms/images/settle-action.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

From here you may click Settle Kingdom, this will open a popup:

<div class="gallery mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/kingdoms/images/settle-modal.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/kingdoms/images/settle-modal.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

You’ll type in a name. Kingdom names must be between 5 and 30 characters. Spaces are allowed.

> <div class="gallery mb-4">
>    <a href="/storage/info/kingdoms/images/additional-cost.png" class="glightbox">
>        <img src="/storage/info/kingdoms/images/additional-cost.png" class="img-fluid" />
>    </a>
> </div>
>
> Each plane allows you to settle one kingdom for free, to settle additional kingdoms you must either take 
> another kingdom or pay.
> 
> **Calculation of cost**: Total Kingdoms owned * 10,000 gold. (ie, 6 kingdoms, 60,000 gold to settle a seventh).
> 
> There is no way to use real world money to get additional kingdoms.

Once that’s done, you’ll click settle and from there a new modal window will popup:

<div class="gallery mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/kingdoms/images/kingdom-management-modal.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/kingdoms/images/kingdom-management-modal.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

As you can see, we start by listing your resources along with basic information about your kingdom including resources gained per hour, morale gained/lost per hour and so on.

You can at any time, rename your kingdom.

Under that information, there are two tabs: Buildings and Units.

You can click on the row in the table to see the details of what it costs to upgrade a building as well as what you’ll gain from upgrading that building including time to upgrade the building. The higher the level the more time it takes as well as resources.

Some buildings such as keep, walls, farm and barracks will cause your kingdom to loose morale per hour if they fall to a durability of zero.

For example, lets upgrade our walls:

<div class="gallery mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/kingdoms/images/building-upgrade.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/kingdoms/images/building-upgrade.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

Here you can see the current durability and current defence as well as current level. Next, we have how much morale this building will give you per hour and how much you will lose per hour should the durability fall to zero.

> ### ATTN!

>You can click and drag the modal, by clicking and dragging the title, this way you can see what resources you have in comparison to what you need, in this case we have the resources, indicated by the: Can Upgrade being yes.

> ### ATTN
>
>You may only upgrade a building up one level at a time. You must wait for that building to finish upgrading before queueing it for the next level.

The cost in resources also goes up per level.

In this case we need a specific number of resources, including population.

Under the cost section is what changes to the building including any additional resources per hour. Since walls are not a resource building, we gain nothing there, but our defence and durability do go up.

You will also notice that it will take 7 minutes to upgrade the building. Let’s upgrade this.

Notice how you had a building queue and unit queue tab? Let’s click on the building queue tab:

<div class="gallery mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/kingdoms/images/building-queue.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/kingdoms/images/building-queue.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

Here you can see our building is upgrading, if we click the row in the table for that building:

<div class="gallery mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/kingdoms/images/building-upgrade-cancel.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/kingdoms/images/building-upgrade-cancel.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

You can see we can cancel the building; we can do the same thing for units in the unit queue.

> ## ATTN!
>
> Canceling a building takes the time it started and the time it will complete as well as the time left to calculate how many resources, including population, percentage wise, you’ll get back. If the building is almost done upgrading you won’t be able to cancel because the builder is almost done, and you would get less then 10% materials back.
>
> You will see a notice if you attempt to cancel when you have, for example a few minutes or seconds left.

Once the building is done, assuming you are logged in you’ll see it in chat:

<div class="gallery mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/kingdoms/images/building-upgrade-chat.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/kingdoms/images/building-upgrade-chat.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

If you are not logged in, you’ll receive an email.

> ### ATTN!
> 
> If you have multiple buildings in queue and you logout, you’ll receive multiple emails when they are finished, one for each building that finishes when its finished. You can turn this off in the settings page.

The same will happen for units (see below).

When your kingdom gains resources per hour you’ll see:

<div class="gallery mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/kingdoms/images/resource-chat.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/kingdoms/images/resource-chat.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

In the chat section. However, for your own sanity, I have made the choice to turn off the email notification for you. You can in the [Settings]() 
section turn this back on. If you turn it on, you will get one email per hour (if you are not logged in) of all the kingdoms that had their resources updated.
We do not show you the list of new resource values for those kingdoms, just present you a table with kingdom, location and that it was updated.

Resources are gained once per hour.

> ### ATTN!
> 
> You cannot buy resources with gold or real world money. You cannot move resources between kingdoms or request resources from other kingdoms.

## Units

Now that we have upgraded a building, lets discuss units.

With in kingdom management you can click Unit Recruitment beside the Buildings at the bottom:

<div class="gallery mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/kingdoms/images/unit-table.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/kingdoms/images/unit-table.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

You might be thinking: Where are all my units, I only have one unit.

That’s because you need to upgrade the barracks, at specific levels you can gain more units to recruit. See the unit table below:
