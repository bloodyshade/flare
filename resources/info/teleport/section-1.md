# Teleporting

Teleporting works much the same way as setting sail. Assuming you can move and are not dead, you can open the teleport section, by clicking teleport on the map.

<div class="gallery mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/teleport/images/map.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/teleport/images/map.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

<div class="gallery mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/teleport/images/teleport.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/teleport/images/teleport.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

From here you can click teleport to go instantly to that new location assuming:

-	It is not water. If it is water, and you do not have the quest item, you will not be able to teleport.
