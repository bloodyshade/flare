# Settings Page

When you need to control your emails, update your security questions or just feel like changing your character name, you can always head to settings:

<div class="gallery mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/settings/images/drop-down.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/settings/images/drop-down.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>
<hr />
<div class="gallery mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/settings/images/settings-top.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/settings/images/settings-top.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

Here you can see a couple areas of interest, your character name – which you are free to change as many times as you like, just remember:

1. Character names may not have special characters in them (including emojis or asci characters).
2. Character names may not have spaces
3. Character names must be between 5 and 15 characters long.
4. Character names may only container letters of any case and numbers.

Character names can also be forced changed by The Creator if they are deemed inappropriate or offensive, see [rules](/information/rules).

Under that, you can see some email settings – you can turn these on and off to your leisure.

Finally, we come to the security questions section at the bottom of the page:

<div class="gallery mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/settings/images/security.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/settings/images/security.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

Security questions are used to verify that you are who you say you are. These are used when you reset your password or submit an unban request.

Security questions must be unique and so must their answers.
