## Locations

Locations in the game can show up as three icons:

<div class="gallery mb-4">
    <a href="/storage/info/locations/images/map.png" class="glightbox">
        <img src="/storage/info/locations/images/map.png" class="img-fluid" />
    </a>
</div>

One is the kingdom icon, the other is a location icon, and the final is a port icon.

- Kingdom icons are your kingdoms. You can only see your kingdom. If you would like to learn more about attacking other kingdoms, see the [attacking kingdoms](/information/attacking-kingdoms) section.
- Locations are usually where there are adventures. Locations can have many adventures, and adventures can provide exp bonuses, quest items, and a chance at gold rushes and item drops. 
  - Locations themselves can also drop quest items for simply moving to that location.
- Ports are where you set sail from or visit the market board to list and sell items. 
  - All ports share the same market board.
